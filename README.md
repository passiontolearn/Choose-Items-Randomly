# Choose-Items-Randomly
Chooses (a specified number of) items we want from a list randomly

The list can be modified by updating the **textarea** section inside the HTML file.
I origrinally created this to make it easier for me to **randomly** select about a 3rd of the students
to check if they prepared their homework... (of course they all did their homework..! Right? ;))
